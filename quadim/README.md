## Use in my own projects?

Of course you can, all functions are packaged. A word of caution though, **no production stability guarantees**. *(Because I haven't learned how to guarantee it yet :P)*

In addition, the [documentation](https://docs.rs/quadim) is still being improved. Focus on `analyze()` and `render()`, that's the all you need to generate quad-images.

## Feature List

- Multithread! Fastest implementation to date
- Process images in RGBA-8 format.
- Merge tests in YCbCr instead of RGB space.
- Since there is no antialiasing, only the left and top borders are actually drawn when `--shape rect --border-width N` (N > 0) rendering parameters are provided. It is more noticeable when specifying a large `border_width` or an abrupt `border_color`.
- For color parameters: you can pass in `DarkSlateGray`, `hsla(168, 100%, 50%, 1)`, etc. all colors that can be written in CSS. *(Thanks to [csscolorparser](https://github.com/mazznoer/csscolorparser-rs))*

## Roadmap

- üî• Allows writing your own brush styles, such as a cross that rotates over time, spots of light that move to the rhythm of the music, filter the specified color in HSL, etc.
- Completely separate analysis and rendering, allowing direct access to the quadtree binary format...
- More friendly CLI: Allow multiple images to be passed in at a time, and automatically detect the most appropriate slicing ratio.

## How it works?

0. Use [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) to parse command line input; Use [src-dst-clarifier](https:github.com/eternal-io/src-dst-clarifier) to handle source-to-destination file mapping; Use [threadpool](https://github.com/rust-threadpool/rust-threadpool) to parallel processing.

1. Analyze Pass

    1. Divide the image into sub-slices according to `QuadimParams::slicing_ratio`. It is often necessary to choose a correct ratio to keep sub-blocks square, such as `-r 16:9`.

    2. For each sub-block, the quadtree is traversed depth-first according to `GenericParams::max_depth`. (Here is a line of code that limits the real maximum depth, so the side length of the sub-image is always greater than zero pixel)

    3. Attempts to merge all sub-blocks.

        There are two cases that can be merged:

        1. The maximum depth is reached, all pixels in this area will always merged, averaged and cached.
        2. Check the four pixels in the **upper left corner** of the four sub-blocks of itself, calculate their standard deviation or range (According to `AnalyzeParams::merge_method`) and compare with `AnalyzeParams::thres_`. Merge if "fluctuation" is small enough, then calculate the average and cache it.

        There are two cases that **cannot** be merged:

        3. The inverse of case two.
        4. Sub-blocks of sub-blocks of sub-blocks... cannot be made into merged.

    4. The additional data structure `[CanvasPixel]` caches "color average" and "should not merge".

        (The pixel color average is stored at the equivalent of the **upper left corner** of the sub-block, easily addressing by right shift. `[CanvasPixel]` is itself one-dimensional, but abstracted to be the same size as the image, two-dimension, which is why the number of pixels of the image cannot be larger than the length of the cache.)

    5. After the traversal complete, the quadtree information has been fully recorded in canvas. Since no data is double-counted, so Quadim is very efficient.

2. Render Pass

    This time it is the breadth-first traversal of the quadtree. Simply put, it is to take the "color" out of the quadtree and use the "brush" (trait `Brush`) to draw on the original image.

    Since the size of the new image is guaranteed to be the same as the original image, it can be operated in-place on the original image buffer, requiring no additional memory allocation, which is another element that keeps Quadim efficient.

## Known Issues

- When drawing a large ellipse/circle, it gets cropped. (See [image-rs/imageproc#519](https://github.com/image-rs/imageproc/issues/519))
